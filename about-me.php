        Firstly thanks for visiting my website; <br><br>
        I'm Kaan and i want to improve myself in the field of software. <br>
        During the pandemic i started to take an interest in economics. <br>
        I started to think of projects where I could realize these two passions at the same time. <br>
        Then i found that idea and search other crypto arbitrage web sites. <br>
        I found really good web sites and apps most of people doing arbitrage with bots,obviously my website can't competitive with them <br>
        But my primary goal is improve myself in the field of software. <br>
        Although the project has no future, this can remain a website I developed for myself. <br>
        And i will keep develop the project. <br>
        I think I've learned a lot since I started the project. <br>
        I believe that I will develop myself more by continuing to develop the project. <br>
        I use Python,HTML,CSS,Bootstrap4,Javascript and JQuery. <br>
        For all the codes for this website you can check my github in <a href="https://github.com/kaanbesgul/CryptoArbitrage">github/kaanbesgul</a> <br>
        I am open to every suggestion and criticism if you want to contact me you can mail to cryptokandela@yahoo.com
